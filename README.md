# JobPortalProject

The project was for my graduation in Softuni. It is mainly written in C#, i've used ASP.NET for the back-end and SQL Server for the database. In the future i am looking to add javascript for the front-end.

It is a job portal for offers in the IT sphere. People can Login and look at offers and apply for them. Users can become employers and post offers themselves. There is also an Administrator role that can has the rigths to do almost anything.

Here are what the different roles are allowed to do:
- Not logged users can only browse through offers.
- Normal users can look at and apply for offers. Also they can become employers by providing a phone number (does not have to be real).
- Employers can do CRUD operations on offers and see applied users on their offers.
- Administrator can add, read, delete all offers (from all employers) and look at all logged users.
